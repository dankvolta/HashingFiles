# hashlib
 This is a project that revolves around the hashlib library in python. 
 The goal is to hash any file input 

# What does this mean? to hash a file
When we have an arbitrary sized file that is read by a function to allow us to generate a fixed-length value from it
hash functions return an integer value.
hash functions can only work on immutable objects 
     - immutable objects: String, Tuple, Frozen set, User defined objects(depending on their impoementation)
     - mutable objects: lists, dictionaries, sets, User defined objects(depending on their impoementation)
    
Hashing a file will help us return a certain type of 'id' which can help us do particular tasks     
Strong hashes with large amounts of bytes can help us distinguish between many different files.
