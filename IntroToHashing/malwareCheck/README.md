In this section, i used Voidtools.com to download a sha256 file, as well as a download installer to show demonstrate how we can compare the generated message digests of each in order to check if we are downloading a malware or not
Here we show the use of the hashlib module in Python to calculate the SHA256 hash of a file and compare it with a known correct hash value.

 1  The code imports the hashlib module, which provides various hash functions, including SHA256.

 2  CORRECT_HASH is a constant variable that holds the known correct hash value of the file. In this case, it represents the SHA256 hash value in hexadecimal format.

 3  The code opens a file named "Everything-1.4.1.1023.x64-Setup.exe" in binary mode using the open() function. The "rb" argument specifies that the file should be opened in read mode as binary.

 4  The with statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed after reading. The file object is assigned to the variable f.

 5   The read() method is called on the file object f to read the contents of the file as a sequence of bytes. It retrieves the entire content of the file.

 6   A new SHA256 hash object is created using hashlib.sha256(). The SHA256 algorithm is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value.

 7   The update() method of the SHA256 hash object is called with the file_bytes variable as the argument. This updates the hash object with the content of the file.

 8  The hexdigest() method is called on the hash object h to obtain the hexadecimal representation of the hash value.

 9   The resulting hash value is stored in the variable file_hash.

 10  Finally, the code compares file_hash with CORRECT_HASH using the == operator. If they are equal, it means the calculated hash matches the known correct hash value, and True is printed. Otherwise, False is printed.
